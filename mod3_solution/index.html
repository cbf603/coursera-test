The history of Chinese cuisine in China stretches back for thousands of years and has changed from period to period and in each region according to climate, imperial fashions, and local preferences. Over time, techniques and ingredients from the cuisines of other cultures were integrated into the cuisine of the Chinese people due both to imperial expansion and from the trade with nearby regions in pre-modern times, and from Europe and the New World in the modern period. Contrary to the beliefs of many, the usage of dairy can be traced to ancient recipes as early as 9th century B.C.

However, it was not legal to consume beef over part of the ancient history.
